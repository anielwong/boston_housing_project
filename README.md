# Boston Housing Project

## Project Overview
In this project the task is to build an optimal machine learning model to estimate the best selling price for a clientâ€™s home in the Boston metropolitan area based on a statistical analysis of the historical data that is available.

This project is based on the Machine Learning Engineer Udacity Course. It is designed to gain experience with the many techniques for training, testing, evaluating, and optimizing models, available in sklearn. 

## Project Highlights
Things learned by completing this project:

    How to explore data and observe features.
    How to train and test models.
    How to identify potential problems, such as errors due to bias or variance.
    How to apply techniques to improve the model, such as cross-validation and grid search.

This project contains three files:

    boston_housing.ipynb : This is the main file where the project is performed.
    housing.csv : The project dataset to be loaded in the notebook. 
    visuals.py : This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

The softwares will need to be installed and ready to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If Python is not installed yet, it is highly recommended to install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

## Starting the Project
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with the notebook. Alternatively, the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook can be used and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens.
